Cloak devision has identified a local gang boss who is working with Dark night, trafficing illicit equipment and drugs for them. They have requested a team of operatives to apprend the gang boss known as "Pink blade' and bring her in so Cloak devision can extract any information she might have from her.

## Briefing

The operatives are sent to a large high rise full of offices. But when they request to talk with "Rebecca Greeson" they are escorted into the basement where they find a large hall thats painted black and is filled with metal doors. They are sent to door number 37 where Rebecca is waiting for them. Inside is a very clean office with metal funiture and a sleek computer thats bussling with video feeds. Rebecca is sitting at the desk and instantly motions the operatives to take a seat. As soon as they have taken a seat se start instructing them on the operation.

Pink blade is hiding out in an abandoned factory on the second level of downtown. Her gang is comprised of 18 gang members, and they are known for estortion, violence and smugling. Recently a Cloak informer has reported that he has seen them talking to a known DN agent. He reported that there was a transfer of DN equipment crates to the gang as well as a large sum of credits.

The operatives are to capture Pink blade and bring her in for interogation. There is a large bonus if she is alive and able to talk, but they will still be payed if she dies in the process. The rest of the gang can be killed if they try to prevent the operatives from completing their mission.
