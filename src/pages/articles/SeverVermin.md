</section-title>

10 days ago a pack of canivorous pigs found a hole in the wall to Canibal sector 1. The opening lead them to a section of the sewers were they have found lots of waste to feed on. 3 days ago one of the pigs broke through the sewer grate and began searching for food in the nearby nabourhood. This has caused the death of a couple of civilians and quite a lot of property damage, which got the Slivers involved. But since the pack lives in the severs they have opted to call in a team of Operatives to solve the situation, and thereby avoid having to deal with the issue. What is unknown to the Slivers is that the pigs have nested close to the terratory of a cell of Shi-An cultists, which will spure further BPN's.

Upon application, the characters are asked to come to the Department of Sanitation to pick up the details. Getting there is not that difficult, especially if the squad has their own transport. The Department of Sanitation is housed next to the Head Office building and contains most of the bureaucratic functions of the Department. The building is a massive block of dark concrete but dispite its size it is dwarfed by the opulent size of the Head Office. They will be met there by a corporate (SCL 8.2a) named Alina Fearston who will explain the situation. The Slivers have a situation on their hands that they can't handle. A pack of carnivous pigs are causing terror in downtown section 2363, and the Slivers are as always unable to manage such petty tasks. Alina's contempt for the Slivers is very clear and she loaths having to spend her time managing such menial tasks. If the operatives conduct the operation quickly and efficiently they will gain her favour, which could be a boon in the future. 

The operatives are to find server grate #257116 which is reported to be the center of all the trouble, they can also contact Sliver sergent Barring Garthon for more information on the situation.
